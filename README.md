# My Website

~~This directory holds the "source code" for my website. I put source code in
quotation marks since my site is just statically hosted HTML with a LOT of CSS,
but I digress.

This site was made in about 2.5 hours when I should have been studying for
finals, so I hope you enjoy!~~

I recently restyled the site, which meant removing a lot of CSS, adding in some
new CSS, and a whole bunch of javascript to make the entire thing more
interactive. Also, dark mode!
